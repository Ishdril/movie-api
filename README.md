## Greetings

This app allows the users to explore the information contained in The Movide DataBase.

## Getting Started

You can fork the project and clone it locally to see how it works.
Follow these steps to set it up:

1. Fork the project and clone it in your system
2. run `$ npm install` to install all the necessary dependencies
3. visit [theMovieDataBase](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api) and obtain an api key. It can be easily obtained following the steps in this website.
4. Create a `.env` file using the variables specified in the `.env.copy`. The value for `REACT_APP_IMAGE_URL` is a royalty-free image that I used in case the API is not providing any images for the movies. Feel free to use the one you like best.
5. run the project using `$ npm start`
